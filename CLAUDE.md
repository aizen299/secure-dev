# SecureOps — Claude Code Project Guide

**Authoritative specification:** [docs/SecureOps_Claude_Code_Project_Specification.md](docs/SecureOps_Claude_Code_Project_Specification.md)

This file governs every Claude Code session in this repository. It is the operational
distillation of the specification, not a replacement for it. Where this file and the
specification disagree, the specification wins — and the contradiction must be reported
and fixed rather than silently worked around.

## 1. Current Repository State (verified, not assumed)

**Phases 1-2 are complete. Phase 3a is complete (scan API + interim authentication
gate). Phase 3b is substantially complete: repository fetching plus the Gitleaks,
Syft, Grype, Semgrep, and Trivy adapters have landed; Trivy image targets and ZAP
have not. Phase 4 is complete (normalization, fingerprinting, deduplication, and
findings persistence with lifecycle). Phase 5 is complete (correlation: contextual
issues, cross-domain links, deterministic severity escalation). Phase 6 is
complete: threat-intelligence capture (EPSS with provenance, ADR 018) and the
risk engine (contextual scoring, max-dominant aggregation, ADR 019). Phase 7 is
complete: fix facts captured from vendor data, and the remediation engine
(consolidated actions ranked by risk removed, ADR 020). Phase 8 is complete:
the security policy engine and gate (ADR 021) plus the durable append-only
audit log (ADR 022). Phases 9-14 are not started.** See §26 for why Phase 3 is split, and for the deviations that split
records.

Git: branch `main`, remote `git@github.com:aizen299/secure-dev.git`.
Go module path: **`github.com/aizen299/secure-dev`** (matches the remote; the product name
in code, docs, and UI remains SecureOps).

What does **not** exist yet — do not assume otherwise, check the filesystem first:

- **Trivy image targets and the ZAP adapter.** Five adapters are registered, so a
  repository scan means secrets, an SBOM, known vulnerabilities, SAST, and
  misconfiguration — but no container images and no DAST. This is also why
  correlation serves no `image:` or `endpoint:` key.
- `cmd/cli/` — no CI client binary
- `internal/assets/`, `sbom/`, `reports/` — the remaining engines.
- **No way to dismiss a finding.** The lifecycle state machine and the risk
  engine both honour `resolved` / `false_positive` / `ignored`, but no endpoint
  performs a transition, so only the automatic resolve-on-rescan can produce
  one. A human cannot yet mark a false positive.
- **No SBOM component storage.** Syft's output is persisted as a raw result only;
  nothing parses it into queryable components, so correlation cannot yet ask whether
  a vulnerable component is actually present in the build.
- `deployments/kubernetes/`
- **No tenancy and no RBAC.** Tokens now carry a role — `viewer`, `service`, `admin`
  (ADR 023) — so a CI credential cannot edit a security policy. But a role is not an
  identity and there is no project scoping: an `admin` token reaches every project.
  T-23 is narrowed, not closed; Phase 11 still owns §15.5's model.
- **The audit log covers policy changes only.** The append-only `audit_logs`
  table exists (ADR 022) and records policy edits atomically with the change.
  Scan creation, project changes, and finding state changes are still log-only,
  so T-24 is narrowed rather than closed.

Sections below describe the **intended** system. Phase 1 established the foundation only.

## 2. Purpose

SecureOps is a unified DevSecOps security assessment platform. It orchestrates
heterogeneous security scanners, normalizes their outputs into one canonical finding model,
correlates related findings across security domains, computes a context-aware project risk
score, generates prioritized remediation guidance, and enforces configurable security gates
in CI/CD.

The product identity — hold this line in code, docs, UI, and API design:

> **SecureOps turns fragmented security scanner output into one contextual security decision.**

It is **not** "a dashboard that runs several CLI tools." The value is the intelligence
layer: `NORMALIZE → CORRELATE → CONTEXTUALIZE → SCORE → REMEDIATE → GATE`.

                                          → Remediation → Policy
                                                        │
                                              ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                                              ▼                   ▼
                                         Dashboard            CI/CD gate
```

The Go API **orchestrates**; it never executes scanners itself. Workers execute scanners in
isolation and are the only component that ever touches untrusted target content.

### Core scan pipeline (every scan follows this)

```text
Target → Target Validation → Scanner Selection → Async Job Creation → Scanner Execution
→ Raw Results → Parsing → Normalization → Deduplication → Cross-Domain Correlation
→ Context Enrichment → Risk Scoring → Remediation Generation → Policy Evaluation
→ Persistence → Report / Dashboard / CI Result
```

Each stage is a distinct, independently testable package. Do not collapse stages.

---

## 4. Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Recharts | consumes SecureOps API models only |
| Backend | Go + Chi | owns API, auth, orchestration, all engines, persistence |
| Database | PostgreSQL | relational; no document store "for convenience" |
| Queue/Cache | Redis | async scan jobs, transient state, caching |
| Containers | Docker | non-root images |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes + Helm | **later phase only**; scanner jobs as ephemeral Jobs |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | least privilege, SHA-pinned third-party actions |
| Observability | structured logs, Prometheus metrics, health checks; OTel tracing where useful | proportional — do not build an observability platform |

**Do not add Python** unless a concrete ML/data-analysis requirement justifies it, recorded
in an ADR. **Do not add** Kafka, Elasticsearch, service meshes, or microservices without a
concrete requirement in an ADR.

### Verified local toolchain

Go 1.27.0 (darwin/arm64) · Node 26.7.0 · npm 11.19.0 · Docker 29.7.2 (daemon running) ·
Compose v5.4.0 · Git 2.50.1 · golangci-lint 2.13.1 · gitleaks 8.30.1 · syft 1.51.0 ·
grype 0.117.0 · trivy 0.74.0 · semgrep 1.174.0 · kubectl 1.36.1 · helm v4.2.4 ·
psql 17.11 · redis-cli 8.10.1 · gh 2.98.0

**Not installed:** OWASP ZAP. Never assume a tool is present — probe with `command -v`
(or run `make tools`), and degrade gracefully with a clear error when a scanner binary is
missing.

---

## 5. Target Repository Structure

Build toward this. **Do not create empty directories ahead of need.**

```text
apps/web/                 Next.js dashboard
cmd/api/                  Go API server binary
cmd/worker/               scanner worker binary

internal/auth/            authn + RBAC
internal/projects/        projects, repositories
internal/scans/           scan lifecycle, job orchestration

internal/sbom/            SBOM storage and querying
internal/reports/         report generation
migrations/               SQL migrations (forward + rollback)
deployments/docker/       Dockerfiles, compose
deployments/kubernetes/   manifests, Helm (later phase)
.github/workflows/        CI
docs/architecture|adr|security|api/
scripts/
tests/integration/  tests/fixtures/<scanner>/
.claude/settings.json  .claude/commands/
```

Package boundary rule: `internal/scanners/**` is the **only** place scanner-specific
knowledge may live. Nothing outside it imports a scanner adapter's parsing types.

Phases 1-2 added these packages, which the specification's structure does not name. They
are deliberate, not drift — keep using them rather than inventing parallels:

```text
cmd/migrate/              migration runner (up / down / version)
internal/config/          environment configuration + secret redaction
internal/logging/         slog construction
internal/httpapi/         chi router, middleware, error envelope, health
internal/netguard/        SSRF address policy, shared by target validation
internal/queue/           the scan job queue contract + Redis/in-memory impls
internal/worker/          the job runner (consumes queue, drives adapters)
internal/storage/postgres/  pgx pool      (implements httpapi.Probe)
internal/storage/redis/     go-redis client (implements httpapi.Probe)
```

The `scanners` root package holds the **contract only** — `Scanner`, `Target`, the
registry, and the safe-exec helpers. Adapters live in `internal/scanners/<name>/`
subpackages and import the root for the interface. The root must never import an adapter,
and must never branch on a scanner's name.

`docker-compose.yml` lives at the repository root (as the specification shows);
`deployments/docker/` holds the Dockerfiles.

---

## 6. Scanner Responsibilities

| Domain | Tool | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| SAST | Semgrep | source-code vulnerabilities |
| Secrets | Gitleaks | exposed credentials/secrets |
| SBOM | Syft | Software Bill of Materials generation |
| Dependency | Grype | known dependency vulnerabilities |
| Container | Trivy | container/image vulnerabilities |
| Repository / IaC / Config | Trivy | misconfiguration, IaC issues |
| API / DAST | OWASP ZAP | dynamic application/API testing |
| License | Trivy / SBOM ecosystem | license and component visibility |

Every scanner has exactly one clear responsibility. Do not duplicate coverage across
scanners without a documented reason. ZAP is **not installed locally** — design its adapter
against fixtures and containerized execution; never make the local dev loop depend on it.

---

## 7. Scanner Abstraction (non-negotiable)

Every scanner is an adapter behind a stable internal interface:

```go
type Scanner interface {
    Name() string
    Version(ctx context.Context) (string, error)
    Scan(ctx context.Context, target Target) (RawResult, error)
}
```

Each adapter directory holds `scanner.go` (execution), `parser.go` (raw output → adapter
types), `mapper.go` (adapter types → canonical `Finding`).

**Hard rules:**

1. Scanner-specific logic stays **entirely** behind the adapter. No exceptions.
2. **Never** write `if scanner == "trivy"` / `switch scanner {...}` branching in
   normalization, correlation, risk, remediation, policy, API handlers, or the UI. If you
   feel the need, the adapter interface is wrong — fix the interface, or add a capability
   flag on the adapter.
3. The core platform must never import or depend on scanner-specific result formats.
4. Adding a new scanner must require **zero** changes outside `internal/scanners/<new>/`
   plus one registration entry. If it requires more, the abstraction has leaked — stop and
   fix it.
5. The UI consumes SecureOps domain models only. Raw scanner JSON never reaches the client.
6. Scanner binary version is captured per scan and persisted (results are only reproducible
   relative to a tool version).

---

## 8. Normalization Model

All scanner output converges on one canonical `Finding`:

```text
id · scanner · scanner_finding_id · category · severity · title · description
file · line · package · dependency · container · image · endpoint
cve · cwe · cvss · exploitability · evidence · remediation
fingerprint · confidence · asset_id · project_id · scan_id
first_seen · last_seen · status
```

Refine the concrete schema during implementation; keep the shape.

**Rules:**

- Raw scanner output is **persisted verbatim** (size-capped) for audit and reprocessing,
  then parsed. Never discard raw results.
- Normalization is pure and deterministic: `raw bytes → []Finding`, no I/O, no network.
  This is what makes it fixture-testable.
- Validate every normalized finding. Malformed or hostile scanner output must produce a
  structured parse error, never a panic and never a silently dropped finding.
- Severity is normalized to one SecureOps scale. Record the original scanner severity too.

### Fingerprinting & deduplication

```text
fingerprint = SHA256(vulnerability_type + normalized_location + package + CVE/CWE + affected_component)
```

- **Never** deduplicate on title equality or string similarity.
- Distinguish four relationships explicitly: `exact duplicate`, `likely duplicate`,
  `related`, `independent`. Do not merge findings because they look similar.
- The exact fingerprint inputs must be documented in
  `docs/architecture/` and covered by unit tests including near-miss cases.
- Fingerprints must be stable across scans so a finding's lifecycle survives re-scanning.

---

## 9. Correlation Engine

Correlates findings across SAST, secrets, dependencies, SBOM, containers, IaC, and APIs to
identify when several findings represent one underlying security problem.

- Correlation operates **only** on canonical findings plus asset inventory — never on raw
  scanner output.
- Correlation is deterministic and explainable: every correlation records **why** it was
  made (the linking evidence: shared package + version, shared image digest, shared file
  path, shared CVE, shared endpoint).
- Correlation **links** findings; it must not destroy them. A correlated group keeps its
  members individually queryable.
- Correlation must not invent relationships. When evidence is weak, emit `related` with a
  confidence value, not a merge.
- Example target behavior: Grype CVE on `express` + Semgrep unsafe Express config in
  `server.ts` + Trivy finding the same package in a production image → one contextual issue
  escalated to CRITICAL, with all three sources retained as evidence.

---

## 10. Risk Engine

```text
Risk = Severity Weight × Exploitability × Exposure × Asset Criticality × Confidence
```

Project score normalized to `0 (secure) … 100 (critical)`.

**Rules:**

- The risk engine is a **pure, deterministic, side-effect-free** function of findings +
  asset context. Same inputs → same score, always.
- No naive severity-to-number mapping. Contextual factors are the point: exploitability,
  exposure, reachability, asset criticality, deployment context (prod vs dev), internet
  exposure, known-exploit presence, whether the vulnerable component is actually deployed,
  affected component count, vulnerability density, confidence.
- The formula, every weight, and every factor's derivation are documented in
  `docs/architecture/risk-engine.md` **and** an ADR before implementation.
- Unit tests are mandatory and must cover boundary conditions, factor isolation, and score
  monotonicity (adding a finding must never reduce risk).
- Weights are configuration, not magic numbers scattered in code.
- No LLM/AI influences the score. Scoring is deterministic; AI may only explain.

---

## 11. Remediation Engine

- Deterministic scanner/vendor data (fixed version, upgrade path, patch reference) is
  **authoritative**. It is the source of truth for what to do.
- Consolidate and deduplicate recommendations across scanners; prioritize by risk;
  always identify the affected component.
- **Never invent fixes.** Never present AI-generated remediation as verified.
- AI assistance is permitted for *contextual explanation* and for *remediation
  prioritization guidance* (spec §4.4) — never for the facts of a fix, and never for the
  risk score itself (§10 is deterministic). Any AI-derived content must be structurally
  distinguishable from verified data in the model, the API response, and the UI
  (e.g. explicit `source: "vendor" | "scanner" | "ai_explanation"`).
- Do not label deterministic rule engines "AI."
- Track remediation status through the finding lifecycle.

---

## 12. Security Policy Engine

Produces `PASS` / `WARN` / `FAIL` from configurable per-project policy, e.g. max critical =
0, max high = 5, max secrets = 0, minimum risk score = 70.

**Rules:**

- Evaluation is deterministic and must **explain the exact conditions** that produced the
  result — never a bare verdict.
- Policy is data (per-project configuration), not hardcoded thresholds.
- Policy changes are security-sensitive: audit-logged, authorization-checked.
- Output is both machine-readable (for CI) and human-readable (for PR comments/dashboard).
- A `PARTIAL` scan (a scanner failed) must never be evaluated as if it were complete —
  surface degraded coverage in the gate result.

---

## 13. Scan Lifecycle & Asynchronicity

**Long-running scans are asynchronous. This is architectural, not an optimization.**

- `POST /scans` → **202 Accepted** with a `scan_id`, immediately. The HTTP request **never**
  blocks on scanner execution.
- Work is dispatched via Redis to workers. Progress is polled via `GET /scans/{id}` (or
  streamed), never by holding a request open.
- Scan states: `QUEUED · RUNNING · PARTIAL · COMPLETED · FAILED · CANCELLED`.
- A partial scanner failure **must not** be reported as a successful complete scan. Record
  per-scanner status, exit code, duration, and structured error.
- Jobs support cancellation, timeout, safe retries, concurrency limits, resource limits,
  progress reporting, and structured failure reporting.
- Scans are durable entities: id, project, commit SHA, branch, started_at, completed_at,
  status, scanner versions, result summary.

---

## 14. Scanner Isolation (critical security requirement)

SecureOps processes attacker-controlled repositories, Dockerfiles, manifests, and archives.

1. **The API server never executes untrusted repository content — no scanners, no builds,
   no package-manager installs, no `git hooks`, nothing.** The API only validates input,
   persists state, and enqueues jobs.
2. Scanner execution happens exclusively in isolated worker processes (later: ephemeral
   Kubernetes Jobs with security contexts and network policies).
3. Every scanner execution runs with: non-root user, restricted read-only filesystem where
   possible, ephemeral workspace destroyed after the job, CPU limit, memory limit, hard
   execution timeout, and network restrictions (deny by default; allow only what the
   scanner provably needs, e.g. vulnerability DB updates).
4. Never invoke scanners through a shell string. Use `exec.CommandContext` with an argument
   vector. No `sh -c`, no string interpolation of user-controlled values into commands.
5. Validate and canonicalize all paths. No path traversal outside the ephemeral workspace.
6. Validate target URLs against SSRF (block link-local, loopback, and private ranges unless
   explicitly configured).
7. Workers hold least privilege: no database superuser, no cloud credentials, no
   registry-write access.

### Resource exhaustion limits (all configurable)

`max repository size · max scan duration · max memory · max CPU · max output size ·
max concurrent scans · max artifact size · max file count · max archive expansion ratio`

Enforce them; exceeding a limit is a structured failure, not a crash.

---

## 15. Security Requirements (SecureOps must itself be secure)

1. **Never** hard-code credentials, tokens, or keys in source.
2. **Never** commit `.env` files, credentials, or key material. A `.gitignore` covering
   `.env*`, build output, and scanner artifacts is required before the first code lands.
3. **Never** log secrets, tokens, or raw finding evidence that contains a detected secret.
   Redact secret values in Gitleaks/Trivy findings — store a location and a hash, not the
   secret.
4. Authentication and authorization are enforced **server-side**, on every request. UI
   restrictions are not a security control.
5. RBAC roles: `Admin · Security Engineer · Developer · Viewer`. Authorization is checked at
   the API boundary and at the data layer for project scoping.
6. Audit-log security-sensitive actions: scan creation, project changes, policy changes,
   finding state changes, user/role changes, remediation actions. Record who, when, what
   changed, previous and new value.
7. Treat **all** of the following as untrusted input: repository contents, Dockerfiles,
   package manifests, archives, uploaded SBOMs, webhook payloads, **and scanner output
   itself** (poisoned scanner output is in the threat model).
8. Validate and bound every external input; size-cap every parse.
9. Use parameterized SQL only. No string-concatenated queries.
10. Containers run as non-root with dropped capabilities.
11. Least privilege everywhere: DB roles, CI tokens, Kubernetes service accounts, registry
    access.
12. **Never disable a security control to make a test or build pass.** Fix the code.
13. No security through obscurity.
14. Maintain `docs/security/threat-model.md`, `security-model.md`, `trust-boundaries.md`.
    Update the threat model whenever architecture changes materially.
15. Trust boundary chain to keep in mind:
    `User → Web UI → API → Orchestrator → Worker → Untrusted Repository`.

## 16. CI/CD Strategy

- GitHub Actions is a first-class integration:
  `PR/Push → SecureOps scan → normalize → correlate → risk → policy → PASS/FAIL/WARN`.
- CI output must be both machine-readable (JSON, for status checks) and human-readable
  (PR summary).
- **CI is attack surface.** Default `permissions: contents: read`; add scopes only where
  required and only on the job that needs them.
- Pin third-party actions to immutable commit SHAs, not mutable tags.
- Never expose sensitive credentials to `pull_request` workflows from forks.
- The repository's own pipeline must run: format → lint → build → unit tests → integration
  tests → self-scan (gitleaks, semgrep, syft/grype, trivy).
- SecureOps must dogfood itself: SecureOps scans SecureOps.

---

## 17. Database Conventions

- PostgreSQL only. Design the relational model deliberately; no document store for
  convenience.
- Expected entities: `users · projects · repositories · scans · findings ·
  finding_occurrences · assets · dependencies · containers · apis · sboms · remediations ·
  security_policies · policy_results · scan_metrics · audit_logs`.
- Every schema change is a versioned migration in `migrations/` with a rollback. Never edit
  an applied migration; add a new one.
- `snake_case` tables and columns; plural table names; explicit foreign keys; indexes
  justified by real query patterns.
- Timestamps are `timestamptz`, stored UTC.
- `findings` carries the stable `fingerprint` (indexed) — it is how lifecycle continuity
  works across scans.
- Finding lifecycle states: `OPEN · ACKNOWLEDGED · IN_PROGRESS · RESOLVED · REOPENED ·
  FALSE_POSITIVE · IGNORED`. Every transition records who, when, why, previous state, new
  state.
- Soft-delete or archive security-relevant records; audit logs are append-only.
- Database migrations are a security-sensitive change — review them explicitly.

---

## 18. API & Frontend Conventions

- REST under `/api/v1`. Versioned. Never silently change a public API contract.
- Resource-oriented, plural nouns; `202` for async scan creation; consistent structured
  error envelope; pagination on every list endpoint.
- Keep `docs/api/openapi.yaml` in sync with handlers — an API change with no spec change is
  incomplete.
- The frontend consumes SecureOps domain models only. No scanner-specific shapes, no raw
  scanner JSON, no scanner conditionals in components.
- Dashboard reads as a security operations view (score, severity distribution, trends,
  gate result, recent scans), not generic CRUD. Prioritize information hierarchy and
  actionability.
- Server state via a typed API client; types generated from or checked against the OpenAPI
  spec.

---

## 19. Testing Requirements

Testing is a first-class requirement, not a follow-up task.

**Unit tests (mandatory):** normalization, fingerprinting, deduplication, correlation, risk
calculation, remediation prioritization, policy evaluation, input validation.

**Integration tests:** API→database, API→queue, worker→scanner, worker→normalization,
normalization→persistence, policy→CI result.

**Scanner fixtures:** `tests/fixtures/<scanner>/` holds realistic captured scanner output.
Tests must **not** depend on live scanner execution — the deterministic engines are tested
against fixtures. Include malformed, truncated, empty, and hostile-output fixtures.

**End-to-end:** at least one complete path — test repository → scan → workers → normalized
findings → correlation → risk score → policy → API/dashboard result.

Rules: new behavior ships with tests. Fixtures containing real secrets are forbidden — use
synthetic values. Never weaken a test or a security control to get green.

---

## 20. Git Rules

- Preserve the MIT `LICENSE` — never remove, replace, or relicense it.
- **Commit only when explicitly instructed.** Never commit proactively.
- Never force-push, never rewrite history, never delete user work without explicit approval.
- Inspect `git status` and `git diff` before reporting work complete.
- Never commit secrets, `.env` files, credentials, scanner artifacts, SBOM output, build
  output, or `node_modules`.
- Do not modify files unrelated to the task at hand.
- Commit style: `type(scope): summary`, e.g.
  `feat(scanner): add gitleaks adapter` · `feat(risk): implement contextual risk scoring` ·
  `fix(correlation): prevent duplicate findings` · `test(normalization): add trivy fixtures` ·
  `docs(architecture): document scanner pipeline`.
- Note: the git remote is `secure-dev`, while the specification's preferred repository name
  is `secureops`. Use **SecureOps** as the product/module name in code and docs; do not
  rename the remote without instruction.

---

## 21. Documentation Rules

- Architecture documentation lives in `docs/`, not in code comments:
  `docs/architecture/` (overview, scanner-pipeline, correlation, risk-engine),
  `docs/adr/`, `docs/security/`, `docs/api/openapi.yaml`.
- Write an **ADR before** a meaningful architectural decision, not after. Each ADR states
  context, decision, alternatives considered, rationale, consequences.
- Initial ADR candidates: `001-go-backend`, `002-postgresql`, `003-redis`,
  `004-scanner-isolation`, `005-canonical-finding-model`, `006-contextual-risk-engine`,
  `007-kubernetes-scanner-jobs`.
- The risk formula, fingerprint strategy, and correlation rules **must** be documented
  before or alongside their implementation — they are the project's core innovation and
  the parts most likely to drift.
- Update the threat model when trust boundaries change.
- Do not duplicate the specification into other docs; link to it.

---

## 22. Development Workflow

```text
1. Requirement
2. Inspect the repository (never modify before inspecting)
3. Identify affected architecture and trust boundaries
4. Produce an implementation plan
5. Human reviews and approves the plan
6. Implement only the approved scope
7. Run tests
8. Run format + lint
9. Run security checks
10. Inspect the git diff
11. Report changes, risks, and limitations
12. Commit only when explicitly instructed
```

A feature request is **not** permission to rewrite the architecture. Work phase by phase;
prefer small coherent changes; preserve existing functionality; do not add dependencies
without a stated reason.

### Validation commands

Discover the real commands from the repository (`Makefile`, `package.json`) rather than
inventing them. Once the toolchain exists, expect roughly:

```bash
gofmt -l . && go vet ./... && go build ./... && go test ./... -race
```

```bash
npm --prefix apps/web run lint && npm --prefix apps/web run build
```

Self-scan (all five binaries are installed locally; ZAP is not):

```bash
make security
```

That target runs gitleaks (scoped by `.gitleaks.toml`), semgrep against pinned rulesets
(`--config auto` is deliberately not used: it requires telemetry to be enabled and is not
reproducible), trivy, and syft/grype.

Prefer the `make` targets — they are the single source of truth for validation
(`make check` for all non-container checks, `make security` for the self-scan, `make tools`
to see what is available). OWASP ZAP is not installed locally. Never silently skip a
validation step — report it as skipped and why.

---

## 23. Definition of Done

A feature is complete only when **all** of the following hold:

- [ ] Requirements understood and existing architecture inspected
- [ ] Implementation plan created and approved
- [ ] Code implemented within the approved scope
- [ ] **Unit tests added/updated and passing**
- [ ] **Integration tests added where applicable and passing**
- [ ] Formatting passes
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] **Security validation passes** — gitleaks (no secrets), semgrep (no new findings),
      trivy/grype on changed dependencies and images, and the change reviewed against
      §14 (scanner isolation) and §15 (security requirements)
- [ ] Documentation updated where necessary (ADR for architectural decisions)
- [ ] API contract / OpenAPI updated where necessary
- [ ] Database migrations reviewed (forward and rollback)
- [ ] `git diff` inspected; no unrelated files changed
- [ ] No secrets introduced
- [ ] Known limitations documented

"It compiles" is not done. "Tests pass but security checks were skipped" is not done.

When reporting completion, state: changed files · tests run and their results · lint status ·
security scan status · build status · known limitations · potential regressions. Report
failures honestly with output; never claim a skipped step passed.

---

## 24. Architectural Change Rules

Material architectural changes require an **ADR and human approval before implementation**.
Material means any of:

- changing the scanner abstraction or how adapters are registered
- changing the canonical finding model, fingerprint strategy, or dedup semantics
- changing the risk formula, its factors, or its weights
- changing correlation semantics
- changing trust boundaries, isolation, or the security model
- adding/removing a scanner, datastore, queue, language, or framework
- changing authentication, authorization, or audit behavior
- changing the database schema in a non-additive way
- changing CI permissions or Kubernetes privileges

Claude Code does **not** unilaterally redefine architecture. The project owner decides
architecture, security model, threat model, data model, major technology choices,
requirements, and acceptance criteria. Claude Code accelerates implementation and analysis
within those constraints.

High-risk operations requiring explicit confirmation: deleting files · changing
infrastructure · changing security policies · modifying CI permissions · modifying
Kubernetes privileges · executing untrusted code · changing authentication · changing
database migrations · installing large or security-sensitive dependencies.

---

## 25. Things Claude Must Never Do

1. Execute untrusted repository content on the API server — ever.
2. Run scanners synchronously inside an HTTP request.
3. Write scanner-specific conditionals outside `internal/scanners/**`.
4. Let raw scanner output reach the UI or the core engines unnormalized.
5. Deduplicate findings by title or fuzzy string similarity.
6. Present AI-generated remediation as verified, or label deterministic rules "AI."
7. Commit secrets, `.env` files, or generated artifacts.
8. Commit anything without an explicit instruction.
9. Remove or replace the MIT license.
10. Disable or weaken a security control to make tests, lint, or builds pass.
11. Build a shell command string from user-controlled input.
12. Put orchestration, scanners, persistence, scoring, and handlers into one package.
13. Start with Kubernetes YAML before the application runs locally.
14. Add Kafka, Elasticsearch, a service mesh, microservices, or Python without a
    justified, documented requirement.
15. Treat Claude Code or MCP as a runtime dependency — **SecureOps must function without
    Claude Code and without MCP.**
16. Assume a component described in this file already exists. Check first.
17. Silently change a public API contract.
18. Report work as complete when validation steps were skipped.

## 26. Implementation Phases

Work strictly phase by phase. Do not skip ahead.

| Phase | Content |
|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation: repo structure, Go API skeleton, Next.js app, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker Compose, config, structured logging, health checks, `.gitignore`, basic CI |
| 2 | Scanner abstraction: `Scanner` interface, Target model, scan job model, lifecycle, worker infrastructure |
| 3a | Scan API (`POST /scans` and friends) + interim authentication — **not in the original list; see the note below** |
| 3b | Repository fetching, then scanner adapters one at a time: **Gitleaks** → **Syft** → Grype → Semgrep → Trivy → ZAP |
| 4 | Normalization: raw result storage, parsers, canonical Finding, validation, fingerprinting, dedup |
| 5 | Correlation: cross-domain relationships, related findings, component/asset relationships |
| 6 | Risk engine (with mandatory unit tests on the formula) |
| 7 | Remediation engine |
| 8 | Security policy engine and gates |
| 9 | Dashboard |
| 10 | CI/CD integration: GitHub Actions, PR reporting, status checks |
| 11 | Security hardening: authn, RBAC, audit logging, isolation, resource limits, network restrictions, secret handling, input validation |
| 12 | Kubernetes: images, deployments, scanner Jobs, limits, security contexts, network policies, Helm |
| 13 | Observability: structured logging, metrics, health checks, tracing where justified |
| 14 | Final hardening and documentation: threat model, architecture docs, ADRs, OpenAPI, README, security review |

**A recorded deviation, 2026-08-31.** The phase list above never named an endpoint
that creates a scan. Phase 2 built the job model, the lifecycle, the queue, and the
worker, but nothing could drive any of it, and Phase 3 (adapters) would have had no
way to be exercised end to end. The scan API was therefore built first, as **3a**.

Two consequences worth being explicit about, because both are deviations rather
than plan:

- **Authentication moved from Phase 11 to 3a.** Not scope creep, and not a decision
  to pull Phase 11 forward: `POST /scans` is a write endpoint, §15.4 requires
  server-side authentication on every request, and the threat model recorded that
  T-11 "becomes urgent the moment a write endpoint ships." Shipping 3a without a
  credential check would have knowingly published the exposure. What landed is an
  interim gate (ADR 006) that authenticates but does not authorize; Phase 11 still
  owns identity, RBAC, and the audit log, which are now tracked as T-23 and T-24.
- **The numbering is the project owner's call.** 3a/3b is a placeholder that keeps
  the record honest, not a redefinition of the plan. Claude Code does not
  unilaterally renumber the phases (§24); if the owner prefers to fold 3a into
  Phase 2, promote it to its own phase, or leave it as is, that decision replaces
  this note.

**A second recorded deviation, 2026-09-02.** Phase 3b is incomplete and has been
since PR #14: Trivy image targets and the ZAP adapter were marked "later" in the
README and the work moved on to Phase 4. Unlike the 3a split above, that was
never written down as a decision — the *state* was recorded in §1 and the
README, but no ADR and no note explained why §26's "work strictly phase by
phase, do not skip ahead" was set aside. This note closes that gap rather than
pretending the sequence was followed.

The reasons, stated now so they can be argued with:

- **ZAP needs a running application, not a repository.** Every adapter that
  exists is a static analyser over a checkout. DAST needs the target deployed,
  an `endpoint` target kind, and network egress from the worker — which cuts
  against §14.3's deny-by-default network posture and is a trust-boundary
  change, not just another adapter. ZAP is also not installed locally (§4).
- **Trivy image targets need registry read access.** §14.7 gives workers no
  registry credentials. Granting them is new trust surface.
- **Neither blocked Phases 4-6**, which needed *some* findings to normalize,
  correlate, and score — not every domain.

What it costs, which is the part worth being honest about: `KindImage` and
`KindEndpoint` are fully modelled and validated in `internal/scanners/target.go`
but no adapter serves them, so a scan submitted for either is accepted and then
fails with "no registered scanner supports this target kind". Correlation
serves no `image:` or `endpoint:` key, which means §9's own worked example — a
Grype CVE plus a Semgrep misuse plus Trivy finding the same package in a
production image, escalated to one CRITICAL issue — **cannot currently be
demonstrated**. The gap blocks the product's flagship claim, not a peripheral
feature.

This remains the project owner's call to schedule (§24). It is recorded here so
that it is a deferral rather than an oversight.

Security is designed in from Phase 1 (isolation boundaries, no shell execution, no secrets)
even though Phase 11 hardens it. Phase 11 is not permission to defer security thinking.
