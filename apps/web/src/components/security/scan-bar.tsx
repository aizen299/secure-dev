 * worker fetch arbitrary URLs.
 *
 * The kind is chosen, not inferred. ".git means repository" and "github.com
 * means repository" both look reasonable and are wrong often enough to matter:
 * a heuristic would clone a website or crawl a repository host, and the failure
 * reads as the platform being broken rather than the guess being wrong.
 *
 * The URL is not validated here beyond an obvious shape check. The API applies
 * the address policy and the argument-injection defences, and a second, weaker
 * copy of those rules in the browser is a place for the two to disagree. What
 * the API rejects is shown verbatim, because "scheme must be https" is exactly
 * what the person typing needs to read.
