// Package all registers every scanner adapter this deployment ships.
//
// It exists because two binaries now need the same set: the controller, which
// resolves adapters to decide what a scan will run and later to parse what it
// produced, and cmd/scanjob, which actually executes them (ADR 039).
//
// Duplicating the list would have quietly broken §7 rule 4 -- "adding a new
// scanner must require zero changes outside internal/scanners/<new> plus one
// registration entry" -- by making it two entries in two places, with a missed
// one showing up as a scan that resolves an adapter the job cannot run.
//
// Under internal/scanners/ deliberately: §5 makes that the only place
// scanner-specific knowledge may live. The scanners root still imports no
// adapter; this is a subpackage, and the dependency runs the right way.
